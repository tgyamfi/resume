          <h4>Greater Houston Partnership</h4>
          <h6>Director, Information Systems, FEB 2013 - MAY 2021</h6>
          <p>
            I was initially hired on as a contractor to help rewrite a legacy web 
            application, and develop custom components for iMIS, a CRM with a focus 
            on non-profits. I was eventually hired on fulltime, promoted to Manager 
            within a year, then eventually promoted to Director of Information Systems.
          </p>

          <h4 class="noteworthy">Digital Transformation Project</h4>
          <p>
            After years of operating on legacy business systems that ultimately
            impeded day-to-day productivity, it was determined that a "best tool" approach 
            was needed. We settled on <strong>Salesforce</strong> as the main CRM, <strong>Cvent</strong> to
            facilitate in person events and meetings, <strong>Constant Contact</strong> for email marketing, and
            <strong>Stripe</strong> as a payment processing platform. We also implemented a 3rd party product, Catalina API
            to allow easier interfacing with <strong>Microsoft Dynamics</strong>, the organization's accounting system.
            Migrating the data from the legacy systems to their respective platforms, then integrating the products
            for seamless communcation all while trying to respect the rule of loose coupling would be the main challenge 
            for this project.

          <h4 class="noteworthy">Event Check-In Kiosk</h4>
          <p>
            <strong>Greater Houston Partnership</strong> is known for holding
            gatherings of various sizes. From Committee meetings, and discussion
            panels averaging <strong>10-50 guest</strong>. To large scale events and Galas
            <strong>(State of the State, State of City, Annual Meeting, etc.)</strong
            >
            attracting <strong>500-1200</strong> attendees per event annually.
          </p>

          <p>
            When guest arrives at the venue they would be directed to a set of tables where they were
            required to search for their name among a sea of pre-printed badges -
            hundreds in most cases. Staff members would be within proximity to
            assist attendees with locating their name badge, but with such a large
            volume of people, a massive queue quickly formed. Staff were also tasked with attempting tracking the number
            of guests that arrived based on badges never claimed, all in hopes of
            getting an approximate attendance count. Post-Event surveys indicated
            that the issue was one of the single most frustrating parts of an
            attendee’s overall experience.

            regular “touch points” and helping them navigate and maximize membership 
            benefits. The volunteers came to be known as <strong>Ambassadors</strong>. At the end of every 
            year the top performing Ambassadors were awarded with a Lifetime membership to 
            the Partnership.

            The application took on many forms over the years, but the last iteration existed as a

          <h4>GHH Corp.</h4>
          <h6>Developer & DBA, NOV 2006 - JUN 2011</h6>
          <p>
            I was originally hired on as a support tech for the company's custom timesheet software, but
            was quickly transferred to a more technical role after displaying a high level of competence
            using SQL. I would later be promoted to Development then DBA before eventually becoming the leader of

            This role mainly involved maintenance, bug fixes, and new development. We'd also development
            custom features for customer with unique requirements. I worked on both the front and backend of the system
            and helped develop features that focused on inegrating 3rd party applications.

          <h4 class="noteworthy">Quickbooks Sync Tool</h4>
          <p>
            This was a stand alone <strong>.NET (Windows)</strong> desktop application used to help reduce the burden
            of keeping the company's Timesheet application in sync with the customer's Quickbooks instance
            (which accounted for <strong>70% of customers</strong>). The desktop application utilized SOAP Web Services
            to send/recieve customers, employees, projects, task, and captured timesheet records. The application also
            allowed customers to define custom mapping between the two systems to cover additional use cases.
